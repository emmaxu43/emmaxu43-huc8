# Soil Classification in WI on a Watershed Basis

To visualize the spatial distribution of soil family in Wisconsin (WI) at a 10m resolution, we propose the use of multiple paralleled Random Forests (RFs) that incorporate the National Soil Information System (NASIS), the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and environmental covariates from geology, landscape and spatial information on a watershed basis.
